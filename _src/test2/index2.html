            <p class="intro"><strong>Come Along Songss</strong> is a collection of songs composed by Minnie O'Leary to encourage confidence, inclusion, and joy in all children. This site was made to keep these joyful songs available for parents and teachers to share with current and future generations. Come Along Songs were originally published in 1981 as Songs of Self Esteem&#8212;a collaboration with Earl White, MFT. Earl asked Minnie to compose songs for the concepts in his books after attending one of Minnie's school musicals and witnessing the ‘beautiful combination of enthusiastic student participation and positive self esteem experiences’.</p>
