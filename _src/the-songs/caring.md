<span class="chorus">

**Chorus**<br />
Sometimes it's time for me to care for you,<br />
Sometimes it's time for me to care for me.<br />
Sometimes it's time to sit right back and<br />
Let you come and care for me too.

</span>

Caring by noticing you just came in the door,<br />
Noticing your jacket's new, or how your knee is sore;<br />
Caring by telling me my batting's looking good,<br />
Telling how you're feeling proud 'cause l did what I should.<br />


#### Chorus

Caring when you clap your hands or pat me on the back,<br />
lt says you like my pitching or you think l'm right on track;<br />
Caring by helping when I need to clean my room,<br />
Helping when l need to write a paper on the moon.<br />

#### Chorus

Caring by sharing all our secret plans and schemes,<br />
Sharing all our troubles, and our stories and our dreams,<br />
Caring by listening to what I have to say,<br />
Where I want to go to, or what l want to play.<br />

#### Chorus

Caring by recalling what we planned to do today,<br />
Remembering the promises I made you yesterday.<br />
Caring comes in many ways, if you'll just look around;<br />
Look at me, and look at you, it's easy to be found.<br />

#### Chorus
