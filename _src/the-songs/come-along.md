<span class="lyrics">

Long ago there was a time when I felt all alone,<br/>
Nobody would talk as l stood out there on my own;<br/>
Wandering around the edge of every single game<br/>
'til that magic moment when l heard them call my name

<span class="chorus">

Chorus<br/>
Come along, you belong,<br/>
Come along, like a song,<br/>
And when you come along<br/>
We are strong.

And we need you to come<br/>
Like the earth needs the sun,<br/>
Come along, you belong;<br/>
We are one.<br/>

</span>


Now I know that when I speak there's someone there to hear.<br/>
There's someone there to help me when I struggle with my fear.<br/>
I always have to do my part; it's waiting there for me,<br/>
And if I start to wander off, I hear this melody<br/>

**Chorus**

If you ever feel alone, just like l used to do,<br/>
Start to look around you cause we're look in' out for you.<br/>
If you're small, we'll guide you;<br/>
If you're hurt, we'll help you out,<br/>
An arm around your shoulder,<br/>
And that old familiar shout:<br/>

**Chorus**
