<span class="lyrics">

I kicked a can along the street, and then a soccer ball  
I'd rather kick that soccer ball than eat or go to school.  
Someday i will be - on "All Star Soccer" on TV  
My team will be up for the World Cup.

**Chorus   
I want to be the best I can be,  
I want to do all I can;  
I want to be the best I can be,  
I want to be who I am.**

I used to jump upon the bed and stand on my head.  
Now there are mats and there are bars, routines on the balance beam.  
I’ll work 'til I claim a place in the Olympic Games  
The medal l will hold will be gold.  

**Chorus**

I used to run among the hills alone, chasing butterflies.  
Now they all say that l should run a race and win a prize.  
All I’d like to do would be run the hills my whole life through;  
No one there but me.  
I’d be free.

**Chorus**

We like to jump and climb and stroll, and roll and kick a goal;  
We like to reach and bend and run, and feel the morning sun.  
When we're on a team  
We're a lot more than we seem.  
When we play, we give and we live  

**Chorus**

We want to be the best we can be;  
Our dreaming will take us far.  
We want to be the best we can be,  
We want to be who we are.
