<span class="lyrics">

**Chorus  
I like it when you listen with your ears,  
and with your eyes.  
I like it when you listen with your heart.**

Sometimes there are such special things    
I think that you should hear,  
I like to think you're tuning in  
So everything is clear.

**Chorus**

I'm happy when you look at me  
As if you want to know,  
The feelings and the thoughts  
That are so very hard to show.  

**Chorus**

And after I have told you  
What it is, the best I could,  
It means a lot for you to let   
Me know you've understood. 

**Chorus**
