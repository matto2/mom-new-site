<span class="lyrics">

I know a kid, used to play on my team. Most  
Valuable player l know.  
That player wasn't the best at the game. But to  
Me that kid looked like a pro.  

**Chorus  
Played hard, played fair,  
Treated other kids with care. No  
Matter what the scoreboard said, that  
Kid came out a winner.  
Always won the game.**

We had some games when nothing went right.  
We would be badly behind.  
That kid kept trying and never gave up  
'til we were all out of time.  

**Chorus**

Some of us think that the referee hates us, so  
Once in a while why not cheat?  
That kid would always play by the rules  
Even though we might get beat.

**Chorus**

Some of us teammates would make a mistake, like  
Kicking a ball the wrong way;  
That kid would never give us a bad time, but  
Just say "good try" -. "that's okay".  

**Chorus**

So any time that I play on a team  
I want that kid by my side. But  
I realize I can play that way too. It's  
Finally time that I tried.

**Chorus  
I’ll play hard.  
I’ll play fair.  
Treat the other kids with care. No  
Matter what the scoreboard says,  
I’ll come out a winner.  
Always win the game.**
