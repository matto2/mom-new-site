<span class="lyrics">

**Chorus  
l hate to hear what I’m doing wrong  
Every day of the year;  
I’d rather hear what I’m doing right,  
And where do I go from here?**

I spilled my milk glass,  
Accidentally dropped.  
Don’t want to feel I’m clumsy,  
Just tell me where’s the mop.	

**Chorus**

Borrowed a basketball,  
Somehow it got lost.  
Don’t want to feel I’m careless,  
Just how much does it cost?

**Chorus**

Sometimes, in my school work,  
I fall way behind;  
Need to see what l’ve done right and  
Try it one more time.  

**Chorus**
