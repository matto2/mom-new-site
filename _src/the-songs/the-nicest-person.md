<span class="lyrics">

The nicest person in the whole wide world  
Is **brave** and **gentle***.  
I see someone near me who is  
**brave** and **gentle**.

And I have a feeling, if I give it time  
and search inside, I will find that  
I can be **brave** and **gentle** too.

The nicest person in the whole wide world  
Is **helpful** and **loyal**,

I see someone near me who is  
**helpful** and **loyal**.

And l have a feeling, if I give it time  
and search inside, l will find that  
l can be **helpful** and **loyal** too.

The nicest person in the whole wide world  
Is **fun** and **honest**, 

I see someone near me who is  
**fun** and **honest**.

And I have a feeling, if I give it time  
and search inside, I will find that  
I can be **fun** and **honest** too.

_*Any word describing a positive characteristic may be used in place of the **bold** words._
