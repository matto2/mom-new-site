<span class="lyrics">

Some of us come from a distant land,  
Some of us from nearby;  
But all of us carry a treasure chest  
With things that gold can't buy,  
With things that gold can't buy.

**Chorus  
And when we share our treasure chests,  
We all grow rich, you see,  
The riches in that treasure chest  
Are what makes you and me,  
Are what makes you and me.** 

Treasures come from years ago,  
From countries far away,  
Treasures come from our families,  
Last year or yesterday,  
Last year or yesterday.

**Chorus**

Holidays, games and stories,  
Languages and songs  
Faith and courage and wisdom,  
And ways to get along, and  
Ways to get along.

**Chorus**
